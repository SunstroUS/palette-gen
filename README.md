# palette-gen

First Vue.js project that helps UI designers quickly get random web colors, that come with a hex code. This project was my attempt at recreating the basic function of https://coolors.co/. On inital load, you'll be greeted with 4 random colors. You have the ability to click on the code of a color to lock it in place, and then refresh that way you can keep colors you like and get rid of ones you don't like.
